Welcome to the KDebugger user guide. Here you will find detailed documentation with examples for KDebugger, which will help you to use it in your projects, as well as teach you how to create your own addons for it!

## What is KDebugger?

It is a set of tools aimed at testing gameplay and tracking bugs while sitting right in the build on the target platform.

Thanks to a clever system of custom extensions (addons), you can customize KDebugger to fit the needs of your project, and if you need to add your own functionality you can use the detailed [manual]({{% relref "/docs/dev-manual/quick-start" %}}) on writing your own addons.
