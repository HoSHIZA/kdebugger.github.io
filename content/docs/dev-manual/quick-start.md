## Getting Started

To create your own addon, just open the package manager and click "create new addon", a menu will open where you can specify basic information about the addon and generate its folder structure.

Several different addon elements are available:
- <b>Tabs</b> for the debug panel.
- <b>Tools</b>, which are independent components.
