## Getting Started

To create your own addon, just open the package manager and click "create new addon", a menu will open where you can specify basic information about the addon and generate its folder structure.

Several different addon elements are available:
- **Tabs** - debug panel tabs, needed for complex things.
- **Tools** - independent components that perform some specific task.
